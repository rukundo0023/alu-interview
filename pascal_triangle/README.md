# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical structure that is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal and is used in various mathematical and combinatorial problems. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it.

## Description

Pascal's Triangle is constructed such that each row contains one more element than the previous row, and each row starts and ends with a 1. The elements in the middle of each row are calculated by summing the two numbers directly above them.

The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:
